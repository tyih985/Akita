### Instructions for Users
Move in the overworld with WASD. Touch an enemy in the overworld to engage in combat. The combat system is turn-based, and each character in the party can perform one action per turn. Select an action to perform by clicking it in the menu on the bottom-right. The battle will end once the enemy's HP reaches zero.
